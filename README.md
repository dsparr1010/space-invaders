# space-invaders
A cute little Space Invaders game made with Pygame by following along with turtorial located on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w). 
I followed this tutorial because I enjoy gaming and want to be able to develop my own small game in the near future. I learned 
concepts like : how to get a character to on the x y plane on key down, how to release a bullet from that character and remain on a constant Y axis,
add background images and .wav files to play continuously and on collision.

## Installation
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
